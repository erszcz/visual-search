# Visual Graph Search

This repo contains a few graph search algorithms implemented in Rust.
The intention of this toy project is education.
First, it's an exercise in Rust programming.
Second, it aims to visualise the state of a few basic search algorithms,
therefore facilitate learning them.

## ToDo

- [ ] Port the visualisation parts to http://ggez.rs/
