# Visual Graph Search

This repo contains a few graph search algorithms implemented in Rust.
The intention of this toy project is education.
First, it's an exercise in Rust programming.
Second, it aims to visualise the state of a few basic search algorithms,
therefore facilitate learning them.

## ToDo

- [ ] `image_buffer` is now dropped from the project,
  but the `image` crate seems to be way easier to use; reevaluate that
